## Overview
Okay! So you've been working hard adding all your wonderful products to your Chec dashboard.  Now it's time to give the user the ability to add those products to the cart.  This process involves a few more steps but don't worry - this guide has you covered! One of the biggest advantages of using the Commerce.js (SDK) is that the commerce object has easy to implement functions that help with building out the cart functionality.  Further and most importantly, every cart method such as `cart.add()`, `cart.retrieve()`, `cart.update()` return an updated cart object which helps keep our cart updated and persistent through a refresh.  Now, let's dive in!

#### This guide will cover: 

1. Setting up variants and handling that in code 
2. The process to add a product to your cart 
3. Making sure to give cart update notification to user 
4. Listing items that have been added to cart 
5. Adding a button to empty entire cart 
6. Capability to increase/decrease quantity from within cart

*This guide strictly utilizes functional react components and relies heavenly on react hooks.  The purpose of this guide is to show how you can use the SDK to build eCommerce functionality and not a true deep dive into react. There will be links to outside resources that can further explain certain react features.*

### Requirements/Prerequisites

- [ ] IDE of your choice (code editor)
- [ ] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) â†’ npm or yarn.
- [ ] Some knowledge of Javascript & React
- [ ] *Bonus* Using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) - specifically `useState()`, `useEffect()`, `useContext()`
- [ ] *Bonus* familiarity with the framework [Semantic UI (react) library](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

### STEP 1. Adding Variants:

This step is important when having products with some sort of variance.  If you have a product without variances, you can proceed to step 2 - otherwise you need to add product variances in your Chec dashboard.  In our example store selling t-shirts most likely you'll have different sizes and colors.  To keep it simple we will be providing options of **Small, Medium, Large**. Once you click on a product, select the options tab ...   

![](src/img/add-variant.JPG)

It's important to note that you shouldn't add a price in this section unless a particular variant yeilds an increase in price.  So in our case no matter which size you select, the price remains $25.  Save those changes and see how we can hadle this in our code! 

#### Handling Variants in the code

The Product object has a property *variants* which is an array with each product variant.  Also within each variant is another property *options* which is also an array with each variant options (ex. Small, Medium etc...) 

![](src/img/variant-property.JPG)

We can handle this data in our `<ProuductCard />` component where we are currently displaying product info.  You can display the options how you like but our example will use a dropdown.  Because of how dropdowns are configured with Semantic UI - we have to provide an options array of objects with a certain format.  

```javascript
    useEffect(() => {        
        
        let finalSizeArray = props.product.variants[0].options.map(option => {
            let sizeInfo = {}

            sizeInfo.key = option.name
            sizeInfo.text = option.name
            sizeInfo.value = option.id

            return sizeInfo
        })

        setSizes(finalSizeArray)
    }, [])
```

The purpose of the `useEffect()` here is that our `<Dropdown />` Semantic UI component needs options to select.  The `useEffect()` allows us to map through our variant options and create our options array before the render.  It's important to note I set the value to the option.id because that is key information needed to add a product (and it's variant) to the cart.  Once complete, we add that value to state so our `<Dropdown />` can then access it.  

```
const [sizes, setSizes] = useState([])
```

This is how our Product Card looks once we add our dropdown: 

```javascript
<Card>
    <Image src={props.product.media.source} />
    <Card.Content>
        <Card.Header>{props.product.name}</Card.Header>
        <Card.Meta>{props.product.price.formatted_with_symbol}</Card.Meta>
        <Card.Description>{props.product.description.replace(/(<([^>]+)>)/ig,"")}</Card.Description>
        <Dropdown
            className="sizes-drop"
            onChange={handleSize}
            value={sizes.text}
            fluid
            placeholder='Select Size'
            selection
            options={sizes}
        />
    </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

Now it's time to write the *onChange* function that will capture the selection and put that data into state: 

```javascript
const [variantInfo, setVariantInfo] = useState()

const handleSize = (e, {value}) => {
    setVariantInfo({[props.product.variants[0].id]: value})
}
```

This function creates an object that matches the proper format for sending variant info using the `cart.add()` method from the SDK. 
```
 { vrnt_RyWOwmPO9lnEa2: 'optn_zkK6oLpvEoXn0Q' }
 ```

 We now have an object variable (`variantInfo`) that contains the variantID along with the selected variant optionID.  


### STEP 2. React Time! (Getting your App setup):

This is where the fun begins!  This example was done using CRA ([create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)).  If you're familiar with React, then you know all about CRA.  If you don't want to fire up a project from scratch, you can fork and clone this repository (make sure to navigate to the proper folder) and run: 

`yarn install or npm install`

This will install the necessary dependencies needed for this project.  This also includes the package needed for the Commerce.js SDK. Once installed run `yarn start` to run the app using react's development server.  

##### Installing Commerce.js manually

One of the great things about this SDK is its ease of use.  Getting what you need into the project is very simple.

1. [Installing via CDN](https://commercejs.com/docs/overview/getting-started.html)

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.chec-cdn.com/v2/commerce.js"></script>
```

2. [Installing via SDK](https://commercejs.com/docs/overview/getting-started.html)

```
npm install @chec/commerce.js
```

### STEP 3. Using Commerce.js in your Project:

Again, the developers at Commerce.js have done their best to make using this tool simple.  If you take a look in the product container component (product-list-cjs-react/src/components/ProductContainer.js) - this is where the magic happens! In order to connect to the source (your chec dashboard) you must first import the package: 
```
import Commerce from '@chec/commerce.js'
```
AND Then create your object variable ... 

```
const commerce = new Commerce('YOUR SANDBOX PUBLIC KEY')
```

#### Using the commerce object

Utilizing this object can be tricky in React (based on life cycle methods and how react renders components) because the commerce object actually is a promise.  In order to handle the promise you must use `.then()` and `.catch()` so that you can process the data.  I won't go to deep on promises and how you handle them, but in this case its acting like an API call.  Because of that we must wrap this promise into a useEffect - so that we can safely store our product info into state.  Using state (which is basically data storage) is a big part of React and if you look at this example - I'm storing the returned data from the promise into state. 

```javascript
const [products, setProducts] = useState([])

    useEffect(() => {
        const commerce = new Commerce('YOUR SANDBOX PUBLIC KEY')
        commerce.products.list()
          .then(res => {
            setProducts(res.data)
          })
          .catch(err => console.log(err))
    },[])
```
If you notice, the setProducts function updates our products variable with all the info from our chec dashboard. 

### STEP 4. Displaying the Product Info:

We now have a variable `products` which is an array of objects and each object being a particular product. We want to to take that data a display it for the world to see! I choose to map of over the array and pass down each product data as a prop to the ProductCard component. 

```javascript
 return (
        <>
            <Grid stackable columns='equal' centered>
                <Image src={hero} fluid/>
                {products.map(product => <Grid.Column width={5} key={product.id}><ProductCard product={product} /></Grid.Column>)}
            </Grid>
        </>
    );
```

Here's a look at the ProductCard Component where I'm parsing the data I need for display: 

```javascript
const ProductCard = ({product}) => {
   
    return (
        <Card 
            image={product.media.source}
            header={product.name}
            meta={product.price.formatted_with_symbol}
            description={product.description.replace(/(<([^>]+)>)/ig,"")}
        />
    );
};
```

#### Conclusion 

Well there you have it.  A quick guide to getting your products to display using React.  As you can see, it doesn't take much to get some products listed on your site.  Commerce.js has done their best to make building an eCommerce site fun and easy.  I really hope this guide helps get you started with whatever project you hope build.
